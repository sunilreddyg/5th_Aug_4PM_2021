Agile Testing:-->

	=> Agile is a iterative developement model.
	=> In agile total software divided into smaller stories.
	=> A set of stories organization develop and release sotfware iteration wise.
	=> An iteration is a small period of time where fully functional software
			developed and release to client with in 1 to 2weeks of time.

	What is advantage to client?.

		=> Welcome chanage requriments even at developement.

	sprint:-->
		Sprint is a duration of time where a few userstories 
		developed end to end.


Scrum:-->
	=> Popular developement framework in agile..

	Scrum Users:-->
		1. Product Owner    [Business Analyst]
		2. Scrum Master     
		3. Developement Team  and  QA Team

	Step1:-->
		BA collect initial requirements and Prepare usecases

		What is UseCase?.
			A Specific Requirement Based on StakeHolder View.

			To Understand Usercase to Every Team member Product
			owner convert into UserStories.

			UserStory:-->
				A small narration of  requirement what client is
				expecting..

				As a ------I want ------So That

				=> As a customer i want to add products to cart
				=> As a Merchant i want to add new product So that user can purchase								can purchase

			Note:--> All user stories will be added to backup folder..

	Step2:-->	[Dynamic planning/ High Level Planning]

				=> product owner select few user stories from
					back up folder and create New Sprint.
				=> Sprint is a duration of small period of time where
					all user stories to develop and test.
				=> All Development and testing process monitor
					by [Scrum master].
				=> If any user story is incomplete Send user story
					back to backup folder and then user story
					will be reassingned in another sprint.

	Step3:-->
			=> After Sprint planning develpemenet team and testing team create sub tasks.

					Develpoer task1:--> Write a program for user story
					Developer task2:--> Draw a flowgraphs to programs
					Develoepr task3:--> Complete unit Testing

					Tester task4:-->  Conduct manual test
					Tester taks5:-->  prepare automation code
					Tester task6:-->  Debug program before execution
					Tester task7:-->  Reporting failure defects
					Scrum Master:-->  prepare metrics for sprint..  


					Note:--> After completing each task developer,testengineer and other
						team memebers move all taks from Inprogress state to done state.


				Story points:-->
					Because story points represent the effort to develop a story
					
				Who provide this story point:-->

					Everyone who involve int userstory developement 
					[Developer, Tester, Operational Team, Metric ---etc]

					What Goes Into a Story Point?

						The amount of work to do
						The complexity of the work
						Any risk or uncertainty in doing the work


				Developement :-->  5   
				Tester	     :-->  3
				Operationals :-->  2

			

				What is Burndown chart:-->

	
				BurnDown Chart:-->

					=> Use the Burndown Chart to track the total work remaining for a sprint, 
						and to project the likelihood of achieving the sprint goal.
 
					=> By tracking the remaining work throughout the iteration, 
						a team can manage its progress and respond accordingly.
