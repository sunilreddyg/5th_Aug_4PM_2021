Software Testing:-->

	Manual
	Automation

SDLC:--> [Software Develovepement Life cycle]

		It is systamatic approach to design,develop,test sofware.


	phases of SDLC:-->
		1. Requirement collection
		2. Requirement analysis
		3. Design
		4. Coding
		5. Testing
		6. Release and maintenance


	Requirement Collection:-->
			
			During Collection phase Busniess Analyst team meet stakeholder. Stakeholders 
			includes[Clients,Industry experts,Sales team,Marketing team,developers ---etc]

			What is agenda of this meeting:-->
				To understand client needs and requirements.

			After exchanging question and answers business analyst team design all client
			requirement into BRS document  [Business requirement specification]

			Other name of BRS is :-->
				URS -->User requirement specification document
				CRS -->Customer requirement specification document.

					Reviews on Requirements:-->
						=> Are they achievable requirements ?
						=> Are they maintainable requirements ?
						=> Are they testable requirements ?
						=> Are they complete requirements ?


			Agile Developement:-->
					=> In agile developement Business analyst called as [product owner]
					=> after gathering client requirements product owner write
						"userstories" accroding to client requirements.

					Epic:-->
							Epic is larger requirement

					Userstory:-->
							A small narration what client exactly wants

					UserStory Syntax:-->
							As a ----Role----- I want -----JOb------SoThat -----Output
						
							As a seller i want to sell my products sothat customer can buy it	
							As a cusomer i want to buy a product online 
							As a customer i can add selected items to cart So that i can buy later
							As a customer i can remove selected items from cart 

							

					Who can write user stories:-->
						Any body who involve in software developement. but most of
						the times design by the prodcut owner.

====================================================================================================>>>		
	Requirement analysis:-->
			During this phase System Analyst [Solution Analyst] analyse time and budget.

			Analyst Team conduct feasibility on client requirement.
					1.Duration
					2.Intime release
					3.budget
					4.Terms and Condition..
					5.Analysis on software and hardware

			After completed analysis of requirements once it approved, system analyst transfer
			all business requirements into software requirement.. After transfer all requirements
			system analyst place in SRS[softwrae requirement specification document]

			SRS:--> SRS is a key document for developement team and testing team.
				Testers understand :--> functional and non functional requirements
				programmers understand :--> Technical information 

				SRS simplified into Two categories:-->
					FRS --> Functional requirement specification document
					NFRS--> Non functional requirement specification document


			What is difference between BRS and SRS document:-->

				BRS--> It contains client needs
				SRS--> To fullfill client needs what are hardwares and software,
						
===========================================================================================================>>
Design:-->
		Design phase is usefull to visuvalize software.After completed srs reviews and approvals
		desing architect team involve in system designs.
		
				HLD--> High level design document
				LLD--> Low level design document


		HLD:--> it explains overall architecutre of software.
			
		Who involve in HLD designing:-->
			Solution Analyst involve in HLD designing

				1. System architecture
					a.User servey diagram
					b.Usecase diagrams
				2. DataBase-architecture
					a. Database design
					b. Class diagrams


		LLD:--> It is a component architecutre,It explains internal structure of
			each HLD diagrams

				3. Active diagrams
				4. Flow Diagrams


		Where test engineer involve in design:-->
			=> To Visuvalize softere before develpement
			=> Inorder to write test steps in testcases
			=> Tester involve in desings to reivew wether designs
				are mapping with specified requirements..
			
================================================================================================
Coding:-->
	Real developement work stats from coding. Every development work start from this phase like [Network, Database,UI --etc]
	Developement Stages:-->
			1. Network and Database developement [oracle,MSBI ---etc]
			2. UI-Developement    [html,css,javascript,angular ---etc]
			3. Core developement  [java,servlets ---etc]

		Note:--> After completed program writing developer desing "flowgraphs" to programs
================================================================================================
Testing:-->
	During this phase testing team condcut software testing inorder to findout developemt mistakes and help
	them to improve quality of software.

	Testing condcut in 3 categories:-->
		1. White box testing
		2. Black box testing
		3. Grey box testing (or) Glass box testing


	Whit Box Testing:-->
			During this test developement team [Mostly jr.developers] check internal
			structure of software by executing programs.This testing also called
			program level testing. [Testing is not conducting in user interface]

				1. Unit Testing
				2. Intergration Testing

	Black box testing:-->
			During this test separete testing team involve . These testers validate
			software functionaly extenally by operating software.  [Testing is conducting over Userinterface]

				1. System Testing             [Quality Assurance]
				2. User acceptance testing    [Quality Control]

	Grey box testing:-->
			[Also known as glass box testing] Mostly jr. Developers involve in grey box testing.
			Grey box testers can have knowledge of both programming and testing.
				[Integration & System testing]


	How long testing will be conducted:-->
			Testing will be performed until client finds it acceptable.
			Another part of tesitng	is verificaton and validation,
			Both testings will ensure software is working as client expected.
===========================================================================================================
Release and Maintenance:-->

	Release:-->
		After completion of software testing, orgranization plan 
		for software installation at client place.

		Organization recruite separate Devops to manage
		releases..

	Maintenance:-->
		=> When client ask future updations develpement team and 
			testing team provide maintanance..
	
	CCB--> [Change Control Board]
			This board members will have knowledge of both 
			developemenet and tesitng. And these borad team 
			make decision to change any requirements in software.
===============================================================================================================
SDLC models:-->
	
	1. Waterfall model
	2. Incremental model
	3. Spiralmodel
	4. Prototype model
	5. Rapid developement model
	6. V-model
	7. Agile model
